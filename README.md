# Recipes

### This application is a recipe book with an ingredient adjusting tool to make adjusting recipes easy.  

###I built this in week 8 to learn how to use a parse database with react and backbone for the MVC, and bootstrap for the layout.

This project started out as just a recipe adjustment tool, but as I kept building it turned into a full fledged recipe book. I enjoy cooking so I was thinking about things I would like, and a layout I would like in an online recipe book. It is still a work in process, and has some more changes and additions yet to come.
